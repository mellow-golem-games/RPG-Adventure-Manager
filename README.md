RPG Adventure Manager is an app for managing an RPG campaign.

## Overview

RPG is built as a way to help manage campaigns for RPG games, especially table top ones. It's built with
games like D&D and Pathfinder in mind, but is generic enough to be used for any game.

It allows the creation of 'entities', which details can be added to and tracked. These include things like
cities and NPCs, and details like the names, how it's currently used in the campaign, and if it's being used at all.
This can help you quickly recall details of a long forgotten NPC, and also see whether your players have heard
of a particular city or not.

In the newest release, we have included our visual story builder. This is a canvas that allows you to drop in, drag,
 and link cards. These cards could be anything, such as story points, and by linking them you can create a visual
 flow through your story. Each card also has the ability to link created entities by typing '@' and a few letters.
 This will search through your entities and find matching ones. Linking one will create the link on the card, quickly
 allowing you to see the entity and its details and create a story telling tool.

 Future plans have that linking feature throughout the app creating a more cohesive experience.

## Setup

RPG Adventure Manager is available as an app (currently IOS only), but also run perfectly fine in any browser.
